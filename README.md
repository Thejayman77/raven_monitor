# raven_monitor
A small python utility that continuously scrapes Coinmarketcap.com for Ravencoin info and displays it in a window.
Easier than having to refresh a page or keep a full browser open with ads and whatnot.

First, rough draft.  Need to add some more error detection and clean up code wherever necessary.  Works nicely
so far, even better when we see the green!

I have it set to update every 10 seconds as not much changes in that time period anyway, and I didn't want to
hammer that site with extraneous traffic.
